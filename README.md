Death Angel Simulator
=====================

This is a simple simulator to calculate your odds of survival in a simple [Space Hulk: Death Angel](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/71721/space-hulk-death-angel-card-game) scenario.

Just one marine, with some genestealers in front and behind and support tokens.

This will explore all the posibilities and make a nice report about how many genestealers are left and if the marine is still standing.

You can try it [here](http://acarrasco.github.io/death-angel-simulator/src/).

TO-DO
-----

* Implement all the different marines
* Make a better report function:
  * Group equivalent final states
  * Provide information about re-rolls
* Allow more complex scenarios
