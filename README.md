Death Angel Simulator
=====================

This is a simple simulator to calculate your odds of survival in a simple Space Hulk: Death Angel scenario.

Just one marine, with some genestealers in front and behind and support tokens.

This will explore all the posibilities and make a nice report about how many genestealers are left and if the marine is still standing.

TO-DO
-----

* Implement all the different marines
* Make a better report function:
  * Group equivalent final states
  * Provide information about re-rolls
* Allow more complex scenarios
